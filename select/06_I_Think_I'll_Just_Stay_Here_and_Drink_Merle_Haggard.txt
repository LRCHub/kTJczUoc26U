I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong and start doin' right
You don't care about what I think
Think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, puttin' you down won't square the deal
At least you know the way I feel
Hey, take all the money in the bank
Think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, listen close and you can hear
That loud jukebox playin' in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hey, hurtin' me now don't mean a thing
Since lovin' her I don't feel no pain
My mind ain't nothin' but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink, yes
