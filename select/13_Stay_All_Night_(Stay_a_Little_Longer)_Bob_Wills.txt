(My key)
Stay All Night
Verse 1
Built around A chord + hammer on 4th string at 4th fret,
Hammer on 5th string at 4th fret.
(Cause the(((Chorus
((((v2
Sitting in the window, singing to my love
Slop bucket fell from the window up above
Mule and the grasshopper eatin ice cream
Mule got sick, so they laid him on the green
V3
You ought to see my Blue Eyed Sally
She lives way down on Shinbone Alley
Number on the gate, the number on the door
The next house over is the grocery store.
Additional verse from live performance
Grab your partner, pat her on the head
If she don't like biscuits, feed her cornbread
Girls around Big Creek, 'bout half grown
Jump on a man like a dog on a bone
